*Something on rock, mainly ice, maybe water.*

On having the motivation, to develop a strong motivation.
On having the frankness, to write a plain language summary like [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020MS002301).
On having the strength, to wrap it up into a coherent piece.

Maybe it's just me, but it can't be just me.
Maybe it's the way it is, but surely there are other ways.
Maybe its time, but why now and why not later?

To have struggled so much, only to be stopped by a gatekeeper.
To have tried so hard, only to be thrown back to the drawing board.
To have anticipated this, only to still want to cry from within.

Perhaps it will be over soon, by soon I mean another year.
Perhaps it will be painless, by painless I mean a numbing feel.
Perhaps tis be freedom, by freedom I mean that of being alone.

*Something on space, with love, like hope.*
