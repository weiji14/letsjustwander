title: Median, not the mean
---

What's in an average?

Everything, *divided* by everything.

Every little detail counts, everyone has their say.
The biggest and loudest hold the most sway.
While the little ones, by their sheer numbers, divide themselves to obscurity.

The word has it's roots in the word 'damage' (see [Average's etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average#Etymology)).
Indeed, it is interesting.
To think of how many problems 'average' has caused, a cursed word it almost is.

What's in a median?

The *equal* acknowledgment of everything.

Everyone may be different, every detail seems trivial.
But as a whole, in its entirety.
The [Wisdom of the Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd) prevails.

Even if there are a few outspoken ones.
Even if there are some rotten eggs.
The median stays relatively safe, remains robust.
It only needs to know where everyone is, doesn't matter how polarizing they seem.
No tweaks, no tricks, it resists all manners of temptation.

Why would we want to be 'average', or above 'average'?

The idea of it, requires that we compare ourself to some measure of the total population divided by the total population.
Essentially, we have to compare ourself to everyone else.
Now isn't that tiring?

En route to being above 'average', you shift the average yourself.
Also, everyone with a similar thought is doing the same thing - shifting the 'average'.
Some make it, some don't, but how many stop and wonder what was it all for?

Instead, "You do you!".
Don't ever let someone tell you what is best!
A wise one once told me, lightheartedly, to stay authentic.

Stay close to the median.
*Be*, the median.

Even as the extremes get out of hand.
Even as the world changes around you.
The median stays relatively constant, remains true.
Shift a little if you have to, but still stay near where you used to be.
At balance, at ease, the way life is meant to be.
