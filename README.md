# [Let's Just Wander!](https://letsjustwander.vercel.app)

[![P2P Blog](https://dat-badge.glitch.me/letsjustwander.hashbase.io/badge.svg)](https://letsjustwander.hashbase.io)

A blog to jot down wanderlusting thoughts with a heck of a mindset.
Built using the [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/11ty.io) static site generator.

## Directory structure ([Jekyll inspired](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/))

```
    letsjustwander/
    ├── _includes/ (contains reusable stuff like templates)
    │   ├── base.njk (the base layout for the blog)
    ├── _posts/ (contains individual blog posts written in markdown)
    │   ├── *.md (the stuff bloggers need to write!)
    │   ├── _posts.json (standard yaml front matter headers for all posts)
    ├── _site/ (hidden in git, contains static pre-generated html files)
    │   ├── name-of-a-post

# Getting Started

How to replicate a static blog like this for the technical minded!
Also, optional steps for those wanting to go the p2p way.

## Install [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/docs/getting-started) static site generator and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) for static hosting
    npm install -g @11ty/eleventy
    npm install -g vercel

## Build html files with eleventy
    # Change directory into the blog folder
    cd letsjustwander
    # Use eleventy to build from `.` directory to `_site`
    npx @11ty/eleventy

## Deploy into the web with Vercel
    # Deploy static html files in the `_site` folder
    npx vercel deploy _site
    # Cleanup old Vercel instances (if any)
    npx vercel ls
    npx vercel rm _site
    # Point the `https://site-<abcdefgh>.now.sh` instance to `https://letsjustwander.now.sh`
    npx vercel alias https://<abcdefgh>.vercel.app letsjustwander.vercel.app

## (Optional) Deploy into the p2p world with Dat/Beaker Browser

Inspired by [this](https://pipette-dev-blog-jimpick.hashbase.io/post/introducing-pipette/).
Note that this may require some expertise to work, rough guidelines below.

    # Use either dat-cli or beaker browser

    # Publish using [dat](https://docs.datproject.org/publish) (**hard**)
    npm install -g dat
    cd letsjustwander
    dat create
    dat share

    # [Publish using beaker-browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/tutorials/create-a-blog.html) (**easy**, but not recommended)
    # Download browser from https://beakerbrowser.com/install/ and install
    # Open browser, open new tab, click on 'New +', and then 'Import from folder'

The result should be a `dat://...` url that links to your files, accessible using dat/beakerbrowser.
If you're good, you should have a `dat.json` file in the folder, otherwise just modify the one in this repo.

Note that you'll need to keep your computer running to sync the files with the dat world.
Alternatively, use [hashbase](https://hashbase.io/) to host your files for you with a pretty url like `yourwebsite.hashbase.io`
